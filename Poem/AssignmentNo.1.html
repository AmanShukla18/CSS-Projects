   <p>
    I met a traveller from an antique land,<br>
    Who said-"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br>
    Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br>
    Half sunk a shattered visage lies,Whose frown,<br>
    And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
    Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>
    Which yet survive, Stamped on these lifeless things<br>
    The hand that mocked them, and the herat that fed;<br>
    And on the psdestral, these words appear:<br>
    My name is Ozaymandias, King of Kings;<br>
    Nothing beside remains. round the decay<br>
    Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br>
    The lone and level sands stretch far away."<br>
   </p>
